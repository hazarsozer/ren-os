lib.adapter.claude_md — hierarchical CLAUDE.md pointer layer (finalize-v0.2
agenda items 1+2).

This module is the DELIVERY MECHANISM for always-on doctrine — the consumer
`lib.doctrine.loader` was missing (the §3.3 gap found in the 2026-07-07
design review). Instead of injecting doctrine at wake-up, RenOS rides Claude
Code's NATIVE global→project CLAUDE.md hierarchy:

  - **Global tier** (`claude_user_dir()/CLAUDE.md`): a managed marker block
    holding (a) a compact behavioral core adapted from Andrej Karpathy's
    public CLAUDE.md guidelines, tailored to RenOS; (b) the recall doctrine
    (agenda item 2); (c) wiki navigation; (d) a doctrine index generated
    from `lib.doctrine.loader.load_all()` — always-on files get a standing
    pointer, glob-scoped files state their trigger glob, agent-pulled files
    state when to pull them.
  - **Project tier** (`<repo>/CLAUDE.md`): a thin pointer block at the
    project's L2 map. It never repeats global content — "point, don't
    duplicate" is the layer's design rule.

Behavioral rules must be INLINE (a model won't follow a rule it hasn't
read), so the behavioral core is embedded; everything retrievable is a
pointer. Three hard guarantees, mirrored by tests:

  1. **Additive, never overwrite**: `apply_block` only ever creates the file
     or rewrites the region between `MARKER_BEGIN`/`MARKER_END`. Content
     outside the markers is byte-for-byte preserved. A torn marker pair
     (begin without end) touches NOTHING and reports `"conflict"`.
  2. **Idempotent**: re-applying identical content reports `"unchanged"`.
  3. **Dedup-aware**: if the user's file already carries the Karpathy
     guidelines OUTSIDE our markers (the founder's own global CLAUDE.md
     does), the behavioral core is omitted so it never appears twice.

This file is native-harness glue by design — `lint_harness_neutral` does not
run over it (that lint covers AGENTS.md + l2-map pages only).

## Behavioral core

Guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes, tailored for RenOS sessions.
They bias toward caution over speed — for trivial tasks, use judgment.

### Think Before Coding
- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask. If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- Known territory? Check memory FIRST — trigger `/ren:recall` before deciding (see Memory & recall below).
- Before building anything new, brainstorm intent and design with the user before writing code (use a brainstorming skill if one is installed).

### Simplicity First
- Minimum code that solves the problem. No speculative features, abstractions, or configurability.
- For recurring or multi-agent work, use the lowest capability rung that fits (quick ask → skill → sub-agent → team → goal) — see the doctrine index below.
- Ask: "Would a senior engineer call this overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### Surgical Changes
- Touch only what the request requires; match existing style; mention unrelated dead code, don't delete it.
- Remove only orphans YOUR change created.
- Never hand-edit inside `ren:`-managed marker blocks, and never edit governed wiki pages directly — durable wiki changes go through the write-queue.

### Goal-Driven Execution
- Turn tasks into verifiable goals ("fix the bug" → "write a failing test, make it pass"); state a brief step → verify plan for multi-step work.
- Loop until verified — evidence before claiming done.
- End substantial sessions with `/ren:wrap` so learnings persist; never game recall/miss metrics — an honest miss is signal, a faked hit poisons the memory.

## Memory & recall (the recall doctrine)

- When a topic touches known territory — a past decision, a project already in the wiki, a person, a preference — trigger `/ren:recall` yourself. Recall is agent-initiated; do not wait to be asked.
- NEVER raw-Read wiki pages to answer memory questions. Recall goes through `/ren:recall` so misses are measured honestly; a raw Read is an unrecorded hit and poisons the metrics.
- Durable facts learned mid-session: `/ren:pin` them. End-of-session consolidation: `/ren:wrap`.
- All durable wiki writes go through the write-queue (propose → review → apply). Direct edits to governed pages are forbidden.

def _navigation_section(wiki: Path) -> str:

## Wiki navigation

- Master wiki root: `{wiki}` — start at `index.md`; chronology in `log.md`; who the user is in `identity.md`.
- Per-project knowledge maps live at `{wiki / "projects"}/<slug>/map.md` (L2 maps: compact facts + pointers). Follow pointers instead of scanning the tree.
- Durable rules and preferences shared across projects: `{wiki / "global"}`.
- Project repos carry a thin `CLAUDE.md` pointer block into their map — the wiki is the single source of truth; pointer files never hold content of their own.
