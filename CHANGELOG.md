# Changelog

## [0.3.3] — 2026-07-09 — "see what you approve"

Instruction-plane promotion is the one decision still gated on you — now you
can see what you're deciding.

- **Wake-up lists pending suggestions** (up to 5, with page and reason)
  instead of announcing a bare count.
- **Wrap previews content** — every held or suggested entry shows the first
  line of what would actually be written, not just its metadata.

The conversational approval model is unchanged: answer in chat, or ignore.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-07-09 — "substrate integrity"

The write substrate's promises (snapshot, journal, one-step revert) now hold
against the two ways they silently eroded.

- **`snapshotRetain` is wired** — the setting existed since 0.2 but nothing
  read it; snapshots grew forever. Every write now prunes to your configured
  retention (default 50).
- **Shell writes into the wiki are blocked** — `echo >`, `sed -i`, `tee`,
  `cp`/`mv` into wiki pages bypassed snapshot/journal/revert without a trace.
  The write gate now catches them (best-effort by design: it stops the
  common accidental bypass, not a determined one — reads are untouched).
- Promotion targets are validated under `global/`.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-07-09 — "wiki-health grows teeth"

The ungated brain's auditor can now see the two most common kinds of memory
rot, and quarantine finally has a door out.

- **Duplicate detection on applied pages** — the wiki-health sweep reports page
  pairs sharing ≥90% of their lines, so consolidation candidates surface
  instead of accumulating silently.
- **Numeric drift detection** — "uses port 8080" vs "uses port 9090" (across
  pages or within one page) is now reported. Report-only: the sweep never
  rewrites your facts; the session asks you which value is current.
- **Quarantine release** — when you tell the session a quarantined page is
  accurate, it releases the banner through the write substrate (journaled,
  revertible). Previously quarantine had no exit at all.
- Honest docstrings: `lib/memory/semantics.py` no longer claims a human
  approver gate that v2.2 removed.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-08 — "the ungated brain"

**BREAKING: the memory approval queue is gone.** Spec amendment v2.2 (two-plane
governance) — a founder ruling after living with 0.2's per-write gate: a second
brain that needs your sign-off on every memory isn't compounding, it's an inbox.

**If you learned the 0.2.1 commands:** `/ren:queue`, `/ren:approve`,
`/ren:reject`, and `/ren:revert` no longer exist. You don't need replacements —
memory saves itself now, and the rare things that DO need you are asked in
plain chat (answer in words; say "undo w-…" to revert any write).

### The two planes

- **Data plane — auto-applies.** Everything descriptive (session narratives,
  lessons, pins, project maps, retrospective findings, identity answers) writes
  to the wiki the moment it's produced. The §3.10 substrate is unchanged
  underneath: every write still carries provenance, lands in the journal, takes
  a snapshot first, and is one-step revertible. LLM-authored content is still
  quarantine-marked — data, not instruction, at read time, permanently.
- **Instruction plane — human-gated, conversationally.** Anything prescriptive
  (`global/` pages, skill-candidates from retrospective) stays pending as a
  *suggestion*: the wake-up hook announces it, wrap asks about it, you answer
  in chat. Promotion through you is the only door from remembered to obeyed —
  the prompt-injection defense is structural now, not ceremonial.
- **Contradictions hold for reasoning.** A new memory that contradicts an
  existing page isn't applied silently and isn't dumped on you either — the
  model resolves it in-session and the resolution is recorded in the journal
  (`resolve_and_apply`); you're asked only on genuine ambiguity.

### New

- **`/ren:wiki-health`** — the autonomous coherence auditor that replaces
  write-time review: dangling pointers (including path-escaping ones),
  wiki-wide contradiction pairs (cross-directory; disclosed cap on huge wikis),
  mass-deletion anomaly detection, quarantine inventory. Fixes what it can with
  logged reasoning; interviews you only on ambiguity.
- **`migrations/queue-governance-2-to-3`** — releases 0.2-gated pending queue
  entries under the new policy (data-plane entries apply; suggestions/holds
  stay). Idempotent, `--check` mode; named in `/ren:update`'s 0.3 notes.
- **`scripts/bump_version.py`** — version SSOT: one command rewrites every
  version literal; a repo lint fails on drift.
- **Friend guards:** plugin-manifest regression tests (the 0.2 manifest-loss
  class can't ship again), shared `parse_worker_json` (fenced/chatty worker
  output tolerated everywhere, incl. trailing prose), doctor companion checks
  (markitdown, yt-dlp — informational, graceful absence).

### Fixed

- `semantics`: negation markers now match on word boundaries — "whenever" is
  not "never". (Previously a false `contradicts` held every fresh install's
  identity write pending. Found because v2.2 made the write path load-bearing.)
- `apply_auto` now quarantine-marks llm-auto content (parity with the approved
  path).
- Wrap's LLM gate no longer silently downgrades durable classifications when
  the worker model appends trailing prose to its JSON.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-07-08

**Fix: `/ren:approve`, `/ren:reject`, `/ren:revert` were unregistered ("Unknown
command").** The queue skill was designed to own these verbs, and every
friend-facing surface (the ingest first-session artifact, the wrap screen, queue
confirmations, the README) tells you to run them — but Claude Code only registers
skill-*named* commands, so all three died at the prompt. Found by the Gate 0 live
smoke test (clean sandbox, real plugin loader) at the exact "approve your first
memory" moment.

- New `commands/approve.md`, `commands/reject.md`, `commands/revert.md` — thin
  command entries routing to the already-tested `skills.queue.lib` functions
  (`approve_and_apply` / `reject_with_reason` / `revert_write`).
- New repo-hygiene lint: every friend-facing `/ren:<verb>` reference (skills/,
  lib/, hooks/, README) must resolve to a `skills/<verb>/` dir or a
  `commands/<verb>.md` (planned-for-0.3 verbs allowlisted). This class of
  phantom command can't ship again.
- Reworded a prose-only `/ren:apply` mention in the queue SKILL.md.

Verified live: local-marketplace install registers 20 verbs; `/ren:approve`
round-trip drives the queue flow end-to-end. 696 tests green.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-07

Green-field rebuild per scope v2.1 ("the measured core") — a clean repo (`renos`), not
an in-place upgrade of the prior `startup-framework` 0.1.0 line. Proven pieces were
carried and renamed (identifiers, env vars, path conventions: `sf-` → `ren-`,
`~/.startup-framework` → `~/.renos`); everything else was rebuilt against the frozen
`0.2` interfaces defined in the Phase 1 write-safety substrate.

**Dogfood fixes (2026-07-07, live fresh-install drive):**

- `stamp_wiki` now binds `framework_version` — fresh installs no longer leave a
  literal `{{framework_version}}` in every stamped page (F1).
- `install_state().l2_maps` counts only `projects/` maps — the master `index.md`
  (itself `type: l2-map`) no longer reads as "a project exists" on a virgin
  install (F3).
- L2 pointer rendering omits the `#anchor` fragment when the anchor is null —
  no more literal `…/architecture.md#None` in queued maps (F4).
- Retrospective task-shape mining skips harness-injected turns (`isMeta`,
  `<command-name>`/caveat/system-reminder markers) — no more junk
  skill-candidates like `resume-session-command` mined from every session's
  boilerplate (F5).
- install SKILL.md contract now lists the directories the skeleton actually
  stamps (F2).

**Finalize pass (2026-07-07):**

- **Hierarchical CLAUDE.md pointer layer** (`lib/adapter/claude_md.py`) — always-on
  doctrine now DELIVERED via the harness's native global→project instruction-file
  hierarchy: install manages a marker block in the user-level file (tailored
  behavioral core with attribution to Karpathy's public guidelines, dedup-aware;
  the recall doctrine; wiki navigation; a doctrine index generated from
  `lib.doctrine.loader` — its first real consumer), and ingest/bootstrap stamp a
  thin per-repo pointer block at the project's L2 map. Additive, never-overwrite:
  only the managed block is ever touched.
- **Skill execution tiers** — every SKILL.md declares
  `execution_tier: deterministic | worker | judgment`; worker skills
  (ingest-project drafting, retrospective enrichment) delegate to cheap
  worker-model subagents; judgment (queue approvals, wrap's L1 narrative) stays
  with the main model. Doctor lints the declaration (`check_execution_tiers`).
- **Retrospective scaffolds** — skill-candidate findings now include an executable
  script scaffold (`proposed_scaffold`), not just an idea.
- **markitdown companion** documented as the raw→wiki source-compile path
  (`/ren:ingest-source` verb planned for 0.3).

**Headline features:**

- **The single write queue** (`lib/memory/queue.py`) — every producer (pin, wrap,
  retrospective, routine, promotion) proposes through one door; nothing writes a wiki
  page directly. Contradiction/supersede/duplicate detection, secrets-scrub, and
  idempotent dedup all happen at the queue itself, before anything reaches disk.
- **Risk-tiered governance** (`lib/governance/tiers.py`) — reads free, a routine's
  bounded memory writes auto-apply with provenance + one-step revert, durable
  knowledge and code/config changes are diff-approved, destructive actions always ask
  and hard-refuse with no human present.
- **Write-safety substrate** — provenance on every write, per-write snapshots, an
  append-only journal, one-step revert, file leases against lost updates. This is the
  frozen foundation everything else (queue, quarantine, promotion, doctor) is built on.
- **Instrumentation with ground truth** (`lib/instrument/`) — real
  `cache_read_input_tokens` from harness transcripts (not self-reported), a calibrated
  chars/token estimator, and the mechanical L3-miss log that makes wake-up's hit rate
  computable instead of asserted.
- **L1/L2 memory + heuristic-only wake-up** — session-scoped L1 (quarantine-bannered
  until reviewed) and per-project L2 pointer-maps (`projects/<slug>/map.md`), injected
  at session start by a wake-up hook with NO LLM call anywhere in its path (unanimous
  council decision) — ranking is token-overlap + recency + path-kind heuristics only.
- **The first-session artifact** — `/ren:ingest-project` scans an existing repo and
  shows "I set up your project memory — here's what I captured" on the very first run;
  `/ren:bootstrap-project` is the empty-map sibling for brand-new projects.
- **Minimal retrospective + skill-candidate mining** (v2.1 D-2) — a deterministic pass
  over instrumentation + journal + session history proposing lessons, instruction
  tweaks, and repeated-task skill candidates through the same queue. No eval-scored
  iteration loop.
- **Governed autonomy carried forward**: `/ren:doctor`'s ten isolated health checks
  (env, wiki structure, frontmatter, schema versions, budget lint, dangling L2
  pointers, graphify status, backup config, global-tier drift, harness neutrality),
  `/ren:update`'s snapshot/migrate/verify/rollback flow, `/ren:backup`'s git-push +
  tarball fallback, and `/ren:routine-init`'s v3 schema (mandatory capability/path
  allowlists — a routine's declaration must bound WHAT it may touch, not just when it
  runs).
- **Harness-neutral knowledge layer** (v2.1) — the wiki's canonical markdown IS the
  `AGENTS.md` surface; one working proof that Codex (a foreign harness) can read a
  project's context from the same files RenOS writes. See `docs/codex-read-proof.md`.
- **Obsidian-vault-compatible wiki** (v2.1 D-1) — relative links only, no state-dir
  leakage into template content, no `{{placeholder}}`/`[[wikilink]]` collisions.

**Harvest provenance:** ported from `startup-framework` 0.1.0 by disposition — CARRY
verbatim where donor logic was proven and self-contained (e.g. `scripts/version-compare.sh`,
the `routine-spec-1-to-2` migration), CARRY-ADAPT where identifiers/paths needed
renaming but logic stayed (backup, update, the identity template), ADAPT where the new
Python-integrated checks needed a different substrate than donor's bash (doctor), and
REBUILD where 0.2's frozen interfaces (provenance, the write queue, risk tiers) had no
donor equivalent at all. The full per-component disposition ledger lives in the
donor repo's own development wiki (not shipped here, per the framework's own
dev-wiki/shipped-skeleton separation).

**Known PENDING (calendar-bound, not code):** exit criteria 1 (≥20-session cache-token
publication), 2 (retrieval hit-rate published against the frozen fixture), 3 (estimator
calibrated against real sessions), and 6 (a friend week) all need real elapsed usage
this repo's tooling already supports collecting — see README.md's "Measured numbers"
section for the honest per-criterion status.
